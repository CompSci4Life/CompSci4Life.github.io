    <h1>Biography</h1>
    <p>In 1982, I was born in Chester, New Jersey. As an only child, my parents
        spoiled me with anything I desired. I invested many years into playing
        tennis until I started to have an intrest in computers. In 1995, I
        learned Java and throughout high school learned how the computer worked.
        In 2000, I graduated from Mendham High School and went to Tufts
        University to study computer science. After graduating top of my college
        class in 2005, I held a job at Google as the Manager of Cybersecurity.
        In 2008, I moved to IBM as the Manager of Artificial Intellegance.
        In 2011, I ventured to Amazon and am now the President of Cybersecurity.
